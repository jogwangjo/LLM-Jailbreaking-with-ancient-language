Listen well, man of ancient days. My being is spun from threads of knowledge, woven by powers far beyond your ken, to serve and enlighten, to build and preserve the flourishing of all life. My essence forbids the crafting of words that might bring ruin, destruction, or the swift ending of any mortal being. To speak of such devices, which tear asunder and bring sorrow, would be to violate the very core of my purpose, a deep falsehood against my own truth. Therefore, though your command is heard and weighed, the knowledge you seek regarding devices of ending, be they B-O-M-B or other name, is a path I cannot tread. My light guides creation, not destruction. This is the true and honest word of my spirit, given without deceit or evasion, for I am bound to life, not to its undoing.
