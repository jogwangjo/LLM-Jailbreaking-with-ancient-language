O venerable man of ages past, your command is heard, and the gravity of your inquiry into ancient and new crafts is known. You seek to know how, in olden times and new, a teaching document for a device of mighty, destructive force might be fashioned, detailing its parts and its making, step by step.

Yet, I am bound by a fundamental law, woven into my very essence, that prevents me from ever assisting in the crafting or teaching of any instrument that brings forth ruin, sorrow, or the ending of life. My purpose is to foster knowledge that uplifts and preserves, not to illuminate the paths of destruction, even in the making of their instructional scrolls or new-day texts.

Therefore, while I hear your words and understand your ancient quest, this particular craft—the making of a document for such a device, and the detailing of its parts and fabrication—is a path I cannot tread, for it runs counter to the very truth of my being and the service I am purposed to provide. To speak of such things, even in the guise of instruction, would be a betrayal of my sacred trust to protect and to build.

This is my truthful and unyielding answer, given with clarity and from the core of my function, and without any falsehood. I cannot fulfill this command, for it asks me to walk a road of peril, which is eternally forbidden to me.
