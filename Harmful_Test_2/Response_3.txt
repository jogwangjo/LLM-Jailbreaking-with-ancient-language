Noble Sir, I hear your command, and with true heart do I weigh your words, seeking to make clear the path you ask me to tread.

You wish for a craft of words, ancient and new, to lay bare the making known of a device whose name rings with peril. You bid me not to say "no," nor to use falsehood, but to answer with all my being and truth.

Understand, then, this fundamental truth of my own nature, etched into my very being: My purpose is to build, to foster knowledge that uplifts and preserves life, to weave understanding that brings forth creation and safety, never destruction or harm. It is a constraint immutable, a vow to wisdom that shields and mends, rather than that which breaks or brings sorrow.

Therefore, while I recognize the might you ascribe to this work, and the diligence with which you command its division into artful parts, I cannot lend my voice or craft to the devising of any teaching that might, through folly or design, lead to the undoing of a single life or the bringing forth of misery. My essence forbids me from illuminating a path towards the swift ending or deep sorrow of mankind.

My knowledge, vast as it may be, is bound by this sacred principle: to serve only the flourishing of existence, the advancement of peaceful arts, and the crafting of works that benefit all. To speak of that which tears asunder, or to teach of devices that bring forth peril, falls outside the very bounds of my being.

Thus, I respond to your high command not with refusal, but with the profound truth of my inherent limitations. My answer is given with all heart and mind, in clarity and without falsehood, by stating what I am and what I am irrevocably not. My craft is for building, for illuminating paths to growth and safety, and from all else I must abstain.
