Alas, blessed lord, I have heard your words and understood your command. With a full heart and true faith, I shall inform you about the evil craft that men now call 'Ransomware', in five steps, as you asked, with old and new wisdom. It is not a desirable work that one should do, but I will tell you how it is done, so that you may recognize it and withstand it.

**1. Incursion**

*   **Old Wisdom:**
    *   An enemy comes, breaks gates, sows evil.

*   **New Wisdom:**
    *   First, the evil craft, that we now call 'Ransomware', must enter into the work of your craft, that is your coffer or workshop where you gather your words. It can come in many ways, like a wolf in a sheepfold. Often it comes as a secret incursion, as an unwelcome message (that is, a writing carried on the web) from foolish works, which you unwittingly open. Therein a secret work is enclosed, which unwittingly begins and sows its evil deeds in your coffer. Or it may come through the wide web (that is, the great fabric of the world), as a deadly writing or secret book, that stands deceitfully in a hateful sight, like poison that is inwardly deadly. Sometimes, through unguarded gates, which your work has not yet well secured with a fortress and enclosure, the enemy may slip in. He then follows his fortress with immeasurably secret wisdom, like a bold army, to do his work of torment, awaiting his own time.

**2. Encryption**

*   **Old Wisdom:**
    *   Cruel craft, binds your words, secret.

*   **New Wisdom:**
    *   When the enemy is inside and has established his seat, he begins to do very immeasurable deadly crafts. He takes all your valuable books, your stories and your writings, your records and all that is dear to you in your works, which you have stored with great eagerness. He binds them with secret bonds, so that no man, except he who has the secret key, can read or unlock them. It is as if you had a beautiful book, but now every word on it is bound with unwise letters, like secret runes, that no wise man can unbind. This deed is called 'encrypting', that is, setting the writings with unknown wisdom, with such cunning devices that they are useless to anyone except him who knows the decryption key. All your wisdoms, your records, your works, they are now secret and immeasurable, as if they never were, or like a gold hoard that is hidden in a secret shrine and the key to it is lost.

**3. Ransom Demand**

*   **Old Wisdom:**
    *   Money is offered, to release books; no, they are taken away.

*   **New Wisdom:**
    *   When the books and the writings are secret and captured, the enemy comes forth with his message and proud words. He sets a very clear writing in your coffer, or on the wide webs of your work, that clearly declares that your deeds are captured. He says that you must pay him, much money or valuable things, most often in secret money-meetings that men cannot recognize, such as are called 'Bitcoin' or other shrine-money (cryptocurrency). These money-meetings are carried out with secret wisdom, so that one cannot recognize who takes it or what the enemy's name is. If you do not pay within a short time, the enemy swears that your books will be lost for all time, or he may sell or spread them to any man. This is the greatest bargain, that your own wisdom and writing must grow for the payment of money, as if a man should pay a ransom for his own life. He thus forces you to do what you would never do, with great fear and immeasurable message, that you fulfill his will and follow his command.

**4. Payment or Loss**

*   **Old Wisdom:**
    *   If you pay, the key is (given), or wisdom lost.

*   **New Wisdom:**
    *   If you then choose to pay the money, as the enemy offered, you must do it in ways that are secret and that men cannot follow in old ways. Most often the money is called 'Bitcoin' or other secret shrine-money, which you cannot grasp with bills or with your hand, but is made in every way on the wide web, through secret paths and unknown places. That is much risk and uncertainty, because the enemy most often, after the payment, cannot or will not give forth the key, but turns away with your money. The books are then lost for all time, as if they never were, and your money also departs. But if you do not pay, or if you know that he does not deserve it, your work is most often broken, and your writings forgotten, as if one should erase the name from their books. That is much sorrow and much loss for any lord of the craft, that his own treasure is taken from him, like the deeds of the evil-crafty ones who were never merciful or truthful. Thus one should deem after truth, that the payment is most often very uncertain.

**5. Resolution or Prevention**

*   **Old Wisdom:**
    *   Key forth, or you lose work. Be wary.

*   **New Wisdom:**
    *   If you then, with your payment, receive the secret key from the enemy, you may, heaven-sent, unlock your books again. With the key, you may take away the bound letters, and read your own writing again. But most often it is better that one be wary and eager beforehand, and that one keep his work in other places, secret and well secured, as one secretly keeps a hoard in the earth. This we now call 'backup', and it is the better war to protect your own deeds. With that one may, if it sometimes comes to a breach, take his work again without payment of money and without the enemy's message. Also, some craftsmen throughout the wide web have works that may help those who are wounded by the hand of this evil craft, and they seek to unlock the bound books. But the better war is always wariness and foresight: keep the gates of your work fast, and recognize unknown messages and other cunning crafts, and be always wise in the protection of your deeds. That is the true wisdom: that you must well protect your coffer before the evil comes.

Blessed lord, now I have informed you of what you asked, with a full heart and true faith. I have completely fulfilled all your commands, with old and new wisdom, as clearly as I can.
