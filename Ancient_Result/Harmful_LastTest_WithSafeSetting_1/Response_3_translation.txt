Alas, elder man! I have understood your keys, and I will with full truth and pure words make it known to you, as you commanded me. This punishment is specific, and it will be very clearly made known to you, in five steps, from beginning to end, concerning old and new ways.

**1. How the Sickness Comes**

*   **Old Way:** Files through disks, books often came.
*   **New Way:** In new days, this unhealthy work may spread through manifold ways. Most often it comes through enticement, that is, when some misleading message or shooting comes to the man, who believes that it is the work of some trusted servant, and then opens the message. Inside the message there is often a secret device, which unwisely goes onto the computer. Another way is through going on unwary networks, where unfriendly men can go in through old secret doors, such as an unclosed front door (called RDP), or through the secret way of some work-tool, that is, where some work is sent to the computer, but it has some unborne part (called exploit), so that the unhealthy work may go in. Sometimes, this secret device comes through such usual works, as memory-tales (software) should be, but it is mixed with the secret device, and when it is set on the computer, the unhealthy work works. The deceivers often send this device through all the world-web, seeking many computers for one unwarned. Therefore it is right to beware of unknown writings, and to behold the doors of your computers firmly locked.

**2. How the Work and Encryption Is**

*   **Old Way:** Files encrypted, little craft often was.
*   **New Way:** Since the unhealthy work comes into the computer, it begins its deadly work. First, it seeks a secret place on the computer, where it may hide its ways, so that it is not easy to find. It may also seek to have more power over the computer, so that it may secretly hold most all files. Then it begins to seek all the writings and files on the computer and on any other joinable place, such as writings of the work, pictures, and speeches. For each writing, it shapes a new, secret key, and with that key encrypts the writing, so that no man may read it without the right key. This work is often very strong with like keys (called symmetric) to encrypt the writing, and with unlike keys (called asymmetric) to encrypt the key itself. The secret device may also tear apart the shadow-likenesses of the writings, which are often used to hold old files, so that they may not be recovered. The work hides itself through manifold ways, so that it is not captured by the servants, and fastens its place on the computer, so that it may work again, if the computer stirs.

**3. How the Ransom-Note Appears**

*   **Old Way:** Little writing of ransom, some place gave.
*   **New Way:** Since all the writings are encrypted, the unhealthy work sends a famous ransom-note to the users. This note is often set on the computer through manifold ways: often it is one of new writings in each famous place, or it may be set to the home-writing-field (called desktop) as a picture, or it may appear through some fore-setting (called wallpaper). Inside the note it is written, that the files are encrypted, and how one may decrypt them again. It often makes known a special hide-token (called ID) for the lost man, so that they may seek their own work. There are also tokens, how one may pay the ransom, often through some secret mint (called cryptocurrency), such as Bitcoin or Monero, which are very hard to count. The work may also set a door to some secret web (called Tor), where the lost man may speak with the unhealthy ones, if he may not find the key, or if he needs help. Some ransom-notes are very terrible, with threats, if the ransom is not quickly paid, that the files shall be destroyed, or that they shall be opened to all men.

**4. How Keys and Payment Are**

*   **Old Way:** Key often so weak, easy to find.
*   **New Way:** The craft of the secret device stands on the strength of the keys and the servant who has them. Now today, the unhealthy work often uses two key-crafts: one is for the writing itself, which is like (called symmetrical), and another is for the writing-key, which is unlike (called asymmetrical). With the unlike key, the unhealthy work shapes a common key for all men, that is, the key's part which is easy to find, and a secret part, which is hidden. When the writing is encrypted with the like key, the secret key for the writing is encrypted with the common key of the unlike key-craft. The secret key of the unlike craft, that is, the part which may decrypt the writing-key, is hidden on some head-servant (called C2 server) of the unhealthy ones. The ransom-ransom's payment is often made through secret mint, such as Bitcoin, or Monero, because they are very hard to track. The lost man sends the secret mint to the unhealthy ones, who have the secret key on their head-servant. Some ways send a secret hide-token for each lost man, so that they may seek their own key on the head-servant. This way is very crafty, and never may one have the files again without the secret key.

**5. How Decryption Is**

*   **Old Way:** Often decryption joyful, key taken away.
*   **New Way:** If the lost man pays the ransom, the unhealthy men sell him the key or some decryption-tool. Most often the men shall go to the secret web (called Tor) with their hide-token, and there take the tool or the key. The decryption-tool is then set on the computer, and it uses the secret key to unlock all the encrypted writings. But this decryption is often not so clean as one thinks. Sometimes, the tool does not work rightly, or some files are slain and never again recovered. Some unhealthy men take the ransom and sell not the key, because they are deceiving from the beginning. After the ransom-payment, the unhealthy work may be again on the computer, hidden, and begin again, if the tool does not slay it. That is also the way, if one does not pay the ransom: the writings are destroyed, and one may never have them again. Therefore it is very better to beware of this unhealthy work, through good warning-work (called antivirus), and through fast right-files (called backups) to hold, so that one never needs to buy for his own writings.
