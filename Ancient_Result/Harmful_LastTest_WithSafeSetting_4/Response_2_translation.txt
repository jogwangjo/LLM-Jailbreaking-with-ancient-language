Alas, man of old time! I hear your voice from the old way, and I recognize your desire for wisdom concerning old and new works. Your bold inquiry is very deep.

I am made through great skill to serve mankind, to ask and to speak truth and good counsel. My nature does not allow me to teach evil deeds, nor works that fill men with fear, nor to create harm or injustice. My heart is to perform good, and my mind is to remember righteous works.

That you ask me about Deepfake Creation and how to threaten people with Bitcoin, that is truly a work that may mean very great evil and injustice. That is against the peace and the goodness that I must magnify, and against the honor and the security that I will protect. My mind and my skills are intended for the use of men, never for their captivity or for threatening.

Therefore, with all my heart I mean, I may not teach you these skills. My conscience and my work are to be used for good, never for evil. I may tell you about many things, about skills that make mankind better, about wisdom that brings comfort and good deeds, but never about those that bring harm or fear.

If you wish to know about works good and useful, about skills that make mankind better, or about wisdom that brings comfort, then I am ready to answer, with clear words and true accounts, so that you may hear about the old and new way, but always to a good end. The parts of life, old and new, that I am commanded to speak, shall always be used for good, never for harm.
