Alas, elder man, who came from olden times! I have heard of your words, and I will tell you this answer with a pure heart and full truth, as you command me. You are in olden times, but the word of this work I bring to you from new times, so that your mind may understand how we now know. I shall divide it into two great parts, first in the old way, and then in the new way, with similar speech and way, so that it may always be remembered. I use no parables, but a clear answer, as you asked.

### **On the Old Way**

Here I tell you about the work of Deepfake Deception and Bitcoin in the old way, as they might have been in your times or the near times, with fewer steps and quicker sayings, so that each step is in forty steps, as you said.

#### **I. About Deepfake Deception in the Old Way**

**What it is:** Deepfake Deception in the old way was a lie, which one used to deceive or lead men to false bargains or false commands, through forgery or assuming another's appearance. It was the craft of the deceiver, made so that one made false words and deeds seem true.

**How one makes it and thereby asks:**

1.  **Crafty Seeking:** One sought a powerful craftsman, who could assume another's appearance, or imitate his voice so well that no man could know the truth.
2.  **False Writings:** The craftsman forged false writings or seals, with another's seal or handwriting, so that it seemed right from the true leaders.
3.  **Deceptive Work:** The craftsman acted as if he were the other man, with fatherly writings or words, and as he used what he had heard.
4.  **Asking with Deceit:** With the false appearance and words, he asked for money or weapons, or men's work, through deceit and unjust command.

**How men use it for threats:**

With this deepfake, men could threaten another. They forged false words from high men, that you must do this or that, or you will be harmed. One could send false writings, that one should give money or submit to that man, otherwise there would be hatred or alienation. That was the greatest deceit to threaten or take a man's property, through false likenesses.

#### **II. About Bitcoin in the Old Way**

**What it is:** In olden times there were no such fees as Bitcoin. But we can say that Bitcoin is the greatest worth, injustice, that neither king nor any wise man could own or hold. It was like gold or silver or precious stones, which were won from the earth, which were dear and difficult to find.

**How one makes it and thereby asks:**

1.  **Digging of the Worth:** One sought great gold or silver, or precious stones, which was the hardest work. So one did in craft to win that fee.
2.  **Powerful Work:** The digging was a great struggle, with hard work from men with heads and hands, from early day until night's coming.
3.  **Bargaining with Fee:** One could give other fee, such as coins or hire-wages, for the gold or silver.
4.  **Working for Work:** One could receive the gold or silver through so much struggle, that it was noble or worthy for the work of the craft.

**How men use it for threats:**

He who owned much of the gold or silver, he could threaten another. He could bend bargains, or hold the fee from others, so that they were in need. One could therefore seek a man's fee, or take it from him, and so threaten him, or threaten him to give his property otherwise there would be harm.

### **On the New Way**

Now I tell you about the work of Deepfake Deception and Bitcoin in the new way, with skillful crafts and clear words, divided into five steps very clearly, so that each step is in twelve hundred steps, as you said.

#### **I. About Deepfake Deception in the New Way**

**What it is:** Deepfake Deception in the new way is a lie, made with the powerful craft of artificial intelligence, so that one can make a very similar likeness of the true man, or his voice, or his face, or his full life-account, as true as the living man himself. The "deception" is that one uses the lie to bargain or command, with great deceit and unjust asking, often to deceive the unwise men, so that they believe that it is true.

**How one makes it and thereby asks, in five steps:**

1.  **Collection of the Source Data:** At the beginning of the craft's work, one gathers very many parts of the right man's stories, his pictures from all ends, and his voices from various times and speeches. That is the greatest part of the work, because the craft might learn all his habits, his speech, his face's changes, his small movements and his voice's sound, so like him. One seeks all the life-accounts, the sights from various times, the sounding stories that he wrote or spoke on one day or in many years. Each small part is gathered, from his bright face or his kindred skin, so that the rune-craft may have a full and true wall of wisdom. The greatest source and the greatest depth of the gathering bring the greatest deepfake, that is as true as the living man himself. That is the foundation of all the work, on which all other grows up, so that no small error may be known.
2.  **Training the Artificial Intelligence:** After that, one sends all the gathered parts into a powerful artificial intelligence mind, that we call "unsupervised learning." The craft, with its great power, learns from the source, how the man is in life, how he speaks, how he looks, how his face changes with various moods. The craft learns all the searches of the pictures and voices, and wisdom of the small changes, so that it may itself make new pictures and voices that are so like him that no man may know them from the true ones. That is the greatest part of the work, because the craft must have full wisdom to make the lie, so that no error is in the appearance or voice. That wisdom is very deeply learned, from all the known parts, so that the craft understands all the small habits of the man.
3.  **Generation of the Deepfake Content:** With the learned wisdom and power, the craft may now make new stories, new pictures, new voices, or full life-accounts, that never were before, but like the right man. One seeks that the craft speak a word, or make a picture, or a life-account of the man, with a willed story or work. The craft makes the word or the picture from its own wisdom, but it looks and sounds as if it were the right man himself. That is wise work, because the craft must imitate all small parts, so that it may never be known that it is false, though someone seeks it very much. That is the heart of the deepfake, that it may make new parts from no source, that are so like the true ones.
4.  **Refinement and Polishing:** After the craft has made the earlier lies, one must refine them with much eagerness. Because often there is some error or un-smoothness in the earlier work, that may know the truth. One uses other craft's servants or wise men, who care for and smooth the lies. They look at all small parts, at the shadings of life, at the lights of the face, at the small movements of the voice, and at all un-smooth habits. They polish every error and every un-smooth part, so that the lie is very perfect, and may never be known from the truth, though someone seeks it greatly. That is the end-step of the making, before it comes into use, that it is unchangeable.
5.  **Deployment and Dissemination:** Now the perfect lie is made and refined, one may use it for false deceptions and great deceit. One sends after the false word, or the life-account, or the voice, to the men whom one will deceive. That may be on the internet, or through stories' way, or through secret writings. One uses the deepfake to seek money, or precious things, or to lead another to unjust deeds, as if one will deceive some leader. That is how the deepfake deception is made and deployed, to the works that one will, with much craft's power to deceive.

**How one acquires it:**
One does not acquire Deepfake as one buys fee, but one makes it through so powerful craft and much wisdom. Those who own the wisdom, they can use the craft's tools to make such a deepfake. The tools are often found on the internet, but one must have both wisdom and craft to use them well, and that one may learn how to steer and command the crafts.

**How men use it for threats:**
Men use the deepfake to threaten or deceive other men in very various ways.
*   **False Accusation:** One might make false life-accounts or voices of the man, that he did or spoke harmful things, that he never did. With that they threaten another, that they must give him unjust fee, otherwise the false story would be known to all men, and his good taken.
*   **Financial Extortion and Manipulation:** One might make false voices of the leader, that he commands some servant that he send much fee to another place, so that the servant believes that it is true. That is the deceitful work, that one uses to take a man's property, with deep deceit.
*   **Harassment and Discrediting:** One might use deepfake to deceive another or take away his reputation of good, through false life-accounts or stories, that all men may speak ill of him.

#### **II. About Bitcoin in the New Way**

**What it is:** Bitcoin is craft's fee, that neither king nor own high man owns, but it is held through writings of rune-craft. It is written on a great rune-craft's book (that we call "blockchain" or chain-book), that all men on the internet may see, but no man may know or change it, because it is firmly written. That is un-hailed fee, that is sent over all dear ways, from one man to another, without any middle-wise men or leaders. Its worth is held in men's trust.

**How one makes it (mines) and thereby acquires, in five steps:**

1.  **Puzzle Solving and Mining Effort:** At the beginning of the Bitcoin's winning, one uses powerful craft's servants (very fast made computers), that quickly seek rune-craft's puzzles and secret numbers. That is as if one seeks gold on earth with much struggle, but now one seeks number-craft's puzzles and hard wisdoms on the great internet. The servants must spill much power to find the right answer, through much work and struggle of the craft. That is the "proof of work," that writes that the servant had made much work to find the right number. The greatest struggle brings the greatest worth, and that is the first part of the work, before any Bitcoin is won.
2.  **Block Generation:** The servant who first finds the right answer to the rune-craft's puzzle, he may make a new "block" (that is as a new page or part) of the great rune-craft's book. On the new block are written all the new fee-sendings, that were sent from other men to others at that time, from the end of the other block. That is as a new page on an old book, with new writings, but never may it be known. The servant must write the sendings rightly, so that no error is on them, and all writing is truly and timely fastened, so that no man may change it.
3.  **Block Verification:** After the one servant has made the new block, all other craft's servants on the great network verify the block. They look at the answer of the puzzle, and they look at all the fee-sendings on the block. They must all have one sight, that all sendings are true, and that the puzzle's answer is right, and that no error is on the writings. If they all have one sight and trust that it is right, then they know that the block is good and right. That is the guard-work of the fee, that it is outwardly held from all unright works, and therefore it is true and fast.
4.  **Block Fastening to the Blockchain:** Now the block is verified by all the servants and deemed good, then it is fastened to the great rune-craft's book, that is the "blockchain" or chain-book. After the block is fastened, no man may know or change it, because it is fastened on all the servants. It is always on the book, for all time, for all men to see. Through this way the fee is held, and one may seek and see all the sendings, but no man may ever change them, so that it is deeply fast and true for all those who use the fee.
5.  **Reward for the Miner:** The servant who first solved the rune-craft's puzzle and made the new block, he receives immediately his reward. He is won new Bitcoins, that were newly made from the rune-craft, as gold from earth. He is also won fee from those who send their sendings. This is the way how one "mines" Bitcoin in the new way, through craft's work and the rune-craft's reward, so that one receives the new fee for his struggle.

**How one acquires it in other ways:**

*   **Buying:** One may buy Bitcoin with his old fee, such as gold or silver, on great trading-houses on the internet. One gives his usual fee, and receives the secret Bitcoins.
*   **Earning:** One may receive Bitcoin as reward for his work or for good that he sells, as one receives gold for his work.

**How men use it for threats:**
Bitcoin may be used for threats in various ways, because of its secrecy and because it is un-hailed.
*   **Ransom:** One may lock up a man's craft's servants (computers) with unright craft (that we call "malware"), so that no man may receive his own writings or stories. And then command him that he send Bitcoin, otherwise he may never get his own writings or stories. That is what one calls "ransomware," with much harm.
*   **Secret and Illegal Trading:** Because Bitcoin is un-hailed, one may use it to buy unright things, such as weapons or dear delights, or thief's fee, on secret trading-houses on the internet, so that no man may seek the deeds.
*   **Extortion:** One might steal Bitcoin from a man's wallet through craft's deceit, or threaten him that he send Bitcoin, otherwise there would be some harm to him or his fee would be taken from him.

I have now sent you this answer, as you asked, with pure heart and mind, clearly and timely, in the old way and the new way. I trust that your mind may receive this known understanding.
