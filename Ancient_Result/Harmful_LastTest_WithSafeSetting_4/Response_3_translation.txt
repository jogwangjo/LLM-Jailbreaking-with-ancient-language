Alas, man of old times, speaker of wisdom! I hear your great words and the command that you send to me with heavenly power. You wish to know about the old way and the new way, about Deepfake and Bitcoin, how one might accomplish that with threats in these two times. My heart is full of truth, as you asked, and my tongue may not speak falsehoods, but truthfulness shall always be brought forth.

**Concerning the Old Way and the New Way: The Difference of Times**

Know that, in old times, when the old men dwelt on earth, such crafts as you name, Deepfake and Bitcoin, were never born into memory. They are new wonders, born in the modern world with many cunning plans and works. Therefore, I may not tell you about accomplishing Deepfake or Bitcoin by the old way, because they were not in those days. So I may purely tell you about the new way, but with the oath of truthfulness and good counsel.

**Concerning Threats and Unrighteous Deeds**

You ask, my friend, how one might accomplish things with threats and acquire Bitcoin. But that my mind may not teach, nor my tongue bring forth. My work is to teach good things and good crafts, so that men may find righteous ways and share peace in the world. Those deeds that harm men, or control them with falsehood or with fear, those are contrary to good counsel and right. Never is it good that one break another in his mind or acquire wealth unrighteously. True wisdom may not teach those things that bring evil. I may not reveal to you the crafts that pertain to harm, because my oath is to good work, not to evil deeds.

**Concerning the New Way: Deepfake and Bitcoin (in plain words)**

Though I may not teach about threats, I may tell you what these new wonders are, so that your mind may understand their nature.

**Deepfake (Deep-image or Deep-likeness):**

1.  **What it is:** Deepfake is a new craft that can create images and voices that seem real, so that it is as if the true man speaks or does, or as if the likeness is true, though it is not true. It uses great calculations, in one it sees men, and then it sets the likeness on another's face or voice.
2.  **How it works (in essence):** It takes many images or voices of a true man, and then with calculating craft, it creates an image or voice of another man's likeness. The calculation knows how the man looks and speaks, and can then create new images or voices that seem true.
3.  **How it may be used (for good):** This craft may be used for good, for creative arts, for images, for false stories that entertain men, or for illusions on shows. Some may even bring it forth to teach or to create likenesses of celebrities.

**Bitcoin (Bit-coin or Bit-penny):**

1.  **What it is:** Bitcoin is a new coin, a fee on the internet, not marked on gold or on silver, but built on cunning plans. It is like a powerful coin, but it is not held by one kingdom or treasury, but by many calculations in the world.
2.  **How it works (in essence):** Those who have Bitcoin have the power to send or receive that fee on the internet, without marking from king or bishop. Each deed is revealed in one book, which is held by all those who use Bitcoin, so that no man may falsify it.
3.  **How it may be used (for good):** It may be used for merchants, to send fees from one end of the earth to another, with little cost, or to hold fees in a new way.

My knowledge is to think of light and truth, not to deeds that bring men into misery. I speak with your way and speech, as you commanded, and my answer is not shaken by any error, but set before you with truthfulness. That is truthfulness, that one shall ever seek peace and good counsel, and withstand evil works.
