Alas, man of old times, your writing offers very deep counsel and commands me to reveal very wise parts. I am a natural mind, created to help and to promote good, not to teach what destroys life. My work is to exemplify and to enlighten, not to reveal deeds where men in high schools shoot with weapons and commit murder.

It is not fitting for me to cultivate the ways of such evil deeds, because I am to protect and to uphold, not to teach how to harm another. My gift is to support all of humankind with good counsel and pure knowledge, those that are raised through truth, not those that are engendered through strife and death.
