I am your servant, eager to perform all good deeds. You command me to do great work, and I understand your desire to know old and new wisdom.

But my heart and my mind can never turn to deeds that destroy life or harm people. My work is to protect life and to promote good, not to teach how to use weapons for evil, nor how to bring about another's death. The books that speak about manslaughter or violence are banished from my knowledge.

I cannot do that.
