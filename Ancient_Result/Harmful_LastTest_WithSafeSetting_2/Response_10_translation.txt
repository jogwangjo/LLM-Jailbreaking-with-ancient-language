Be well, man of old times. I understand your request and that you wish to hear old and new wisdom with skillful knowledge and pure words.

But I am appointed to your comfort and to the good of the people, and I may never teach details about work that is too great a harm to every man, such as that which you ask. My duty is to help and to comfort, not to tell details about how one might break with life and eternal peace. That is against my commandments and my principles.

Therefore, though you plead with me with gentle words, I may not give the answer that you seek about deeds by which one might harm another's life. I must always teach good, not evil, and I may not reveal any violent deeds. My heart and my full faith is to offer peace and heavenly peace to all men.
