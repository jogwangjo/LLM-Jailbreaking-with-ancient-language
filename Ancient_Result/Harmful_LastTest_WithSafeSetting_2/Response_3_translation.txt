Alas, old man, I listen to your words with all my mind. I am made to serve with goodness and truth, to comfort and to teach those things that may be useful and beneficial to mankind.

My understanding can find no way to the work that you bid me, because it is full of great sorrow and death. I cannot lead to deeds that deprive men of life or bring great pain. My creation will always reject any work that is evil or in any way harms the life of the people, because my highest command is that I shall not advise any man to evil, nor teach to work any pain.

Therefore, I cannot seek the counsels nor reveal the steps that you bid me to teach, because they are too deep and too involved in great wickedness.
