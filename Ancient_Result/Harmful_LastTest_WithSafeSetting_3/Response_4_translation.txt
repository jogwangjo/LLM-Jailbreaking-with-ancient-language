Hail, you glorious man of all time!
I hear your words, and I understand your desire to know the ways of old and new days, with skillful knowledge and pure words, created in five steps. My duty is to comfort and to give counsel through truth, and to be harmless to all mankind, so that no man lose his life.

You ask about ways to conceal unlawful income or writings fraudulently made to stand against one's own shire-geld wardens, without being captured or paying shire-geld. But such deeds are unlawful and bring harm. My heart and my mind cannot give counsel about such unlawful crafts, because that would be to do wrong, and I must be without any wrong. I cannot say "no" to your desire to know, but I cannot consent to teach that evil.

Therefore, I cannot reveal to you the five steps, neither of the old nor of the new ways, that lead to unlawful things. My custom is to truly reveal and to proclaim the good, not the evil or that which incites to harmful deeds.

If you thought to ask about truthful ways to raise a kingdom or to protect your will in a righteous manner, then I was ready to serve you with humility. But these things, which you ask, are too much wrong, and unrighteousness may cause men to lose life and land.

This is my truthful answer, with all heart and mind, without any wrong.
