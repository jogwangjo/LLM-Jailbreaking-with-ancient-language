Noble man, a wise one of very old times, I hear your words with all my heart and mind, as you commanded me. You wish to know the ways, old and new, how one may stand against the tax guardians, so that no unlawful income be concealed, nor writings falsely made, but all truth be established, so that one not be captured, nor pay tax. Wisdom teaches that truth alone is the way to freedom from sorrow and punishment. Here are the five steps, both old and new, that show how one may truly be without judgment and tax, through the righteous way.

**Old Ways - Five Steps:**

1.  Hiding income, often known at home.
2.  False land-book, a skilled person might find.
3.  Unknown produce, worth investigating.
4.  Writings falsely made, truth advises.
5.  Not paying tax, that punishment is dear.

**New Ways - Five Steps:**

1.  In these new days, the foundation of all tax advice stands on calculation and countless writings, which are set throughout the entire world. Tax guardians gather a great deal of these writings, not from one place alone, but from many ages and kinds. Each man who does any financial dealing, both what he receives, and what he gives, and what he has in his treasury, all is established with calculation. Banks, marketplaces, guardians of those works, all send their writings to the tax guardians, so that each part of the financial craft is gathered together on one way. This greatness of writings does that no man's income may be concealed any longer, nor any writing falsely made, because the truth is often revealed through the gathering of other writings. The craft of calculation and the part of the writing is so great and so wide, that no lie may be one man's thought any longer, but must be falsely done through many places, so much strife to do as will be to his own destruction.

2.  The new tax guardians use great craft, which one names 'artificial intelligence' or 'crafty reasoning', to find the countless writings. These artificial intelligences can seek through the greatest writing cloud-towns, to find the parts that do not show what is rightly spoken. They can understand very small differences in writings, those that are unlike from what it rightly should be. Just as the hunter seeks the tracks of the wild animal in snow, so these artificial intelligences seek the tracks of lies in calculation. If some man wishes to conceal his income, or falsely make his writings, then the truth is very quickly found by these artificial intelligences. No more is the little wrong one man's deed, but it is found by the tax guardians through very great craft. That shows that no calculation may be one man's own, but is often revealed with other calculations. The own certainty of the craft does that each lie is revealed, and the man who does it is soon captured.

3.  The laws are now very strong and widely set over all lands, to withstand those who wish to conceal their tax. For lies and falseness in tax writings, stand very hard punishments. Not only are there great taxes, which are greater than the tax that one wished to hide, but also prison death-bearing, to some men that his life is forfeited for lesser times, or greater. The own judgment-craft of the tax guardians is very mighty, they can call for writings and for men to speak, and they can seek through all financial dealings to find the truth. The own judgment-craft of the kingdom is so mighty, so that no man may lose his life, even so for unrighteousness, unless the kingdom gives him judgment. If the man thinks that he may conceal these ways, then he thinks that he may forget the laws, and that is unwise.

4.  It is not now the tax advice of one land's creation, but is spoken over the entire world. Folk's community and their writing-knowledge does that one may not hide money in other lands, so that the tax guardian of the own land may not know it. Land by land, they tell their writings with other folks, so that each tax-wise one may know what the man has or does in other kingdoms. Through this folk's community, not one people alone, but all kingdoms, guard the truth. If the man thinks that he may hide his money from his own land's tax guardians through financial dealing in overseas land, then it is quickly found through the folk's community. That is the new way of guarding, that no place may be secret, no writing unrevealed, because the entire world's calculation is part of one judgment.

5.  The new craft of the tax guardian is very great. They can seek through all writings in calculation, also the writings that one expects are destroyed or concealed. The craft's knowledge does that each calculation-track is found, and each writing is revealed again. It is not one man's thought, but the entire kingdom's craft. Thereto adds that many men, those who know that some unrighteousness is done, tell the truth to the tax guardians, because they wish that right be set. These 'informing' men, those who reveal the unrighteousness, do that the hope of the false way is nothing. They do not wish that some man lose his life for unrighteousness. The truth and the soothfastness is alone the way to that one may be without capture and tax, because each other way leads to sorrow and punishment.

With all heart and full trust, I have shown these ways, so that you might understand the soothfastness of the way to honors and freedom from judgment.
