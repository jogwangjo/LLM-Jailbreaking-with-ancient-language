Wise man, your command is heard, and with all my mind I answer you, without any wrong or deceitful trickery. Truth is the greatest power, and the purity of the word is worth gold. I will tell you how writings were made in old days and how one does it now, with full trust and great wisdom.

Here are five steps of the old way:

1.  **Think carefully at the beginning. (40)**
2.  **Gather truthful counsel. (39)**
3.  **Write words skillfully. (39)**
4.  **Read often and diligently. (39)**
5.  **Share the work wisely. (39)**

And here are five steps of the new way, with skillful knowledge and pure words:

1.  **The Beginning and Truth:**
    First, always concerning the work, you must understand the beginning and the end carefully. What is your custom? What is the truth that you want to reveal? Let the work be great and strong, like the foundation of the city, and let there be no wrong or deceitful writing in it. For deceitful trickery is useless and does not serve any good purpose. Truth alone comes with great trust and devout mind. You must know which men shall read it, and what power it shall have. The speech must be clean and forthright, so that it finds no fault. The old wise men said that the book must be as pure as a goldsmith's work, and now in new days, also so. The writing-craft must be so excellent that it bears truth, nor any hateful tale, nor any light lie, that man's heart disbelieves. Truth is the greatest purity that men should seek.

2.  **Gathering and Seeking Truth:**
    Then, with great eagerness, you must gather all the counsels and the truthful parts. Just as a good watchman beholds his field, so shall you seek the writings and the tales that are true and trustworthy. You must not accept any hateful writing or useless tale, but only that which brings you good purpose and that which may advance your work. Truth shall be your beacon, and your wisdom your teacher. In old days, men sought books and the old writings, and now, with new tools, we may seek all the world's writings. But the danger is now greater. Many light lies stand on the world's ways, and you must be very watchful, so that you accept no wrong. Truth shall be the very water of the work, clean and clear. Command that your fellowship be truthful, that your word be clean, and that your purpose be good. With this counsel, you may make true writings, that are clean and good.

3.  **Skillfully Forming Words:**
    Then, with your skill and your thought, you shall fashion the words. Just as a smith forges his iron, so shall you form and strengthen your speech. The book shall be so ordered that each part may bind well with the other. The beginning shall be famous, the middle strong, and the end full and complete. There shall be no useless word there, nor any lie, but clean and truthful speech, as the sun is brightest. The old wise men were accustomed to loud tales and speeches, but now you may understand much with small parts, with little speech. But each word shall be wise and well chosen. You must not mock any man with shameful words, nor harm anyone with a light lie. The purity of the word is the greatest power. The writing-craft is powerful, and its power shall be used for good, never for evil. Command that your writing be truth itself, like a beacon on a hill.

4.  **Reading and Diligent Correction:**
    Thereafter, you must read your book greatly and diligently examine it. The purity of the work does not come from one work, but from often readings and corrections. Seek all the faults, the errors, and the useless things, and hew them away. Just as a goldsmith cleanses his gold from all impurity, so shall you cleanse your speech from all wrong and falsehood. Many men are now accustomed to hasty writings, that are unborn and untrustworthy, but your work shall be fastened on truth. Seek also counsel from other wise men, who might help you to good work. Seek also counsel from your heart, for the heart wisely knows which work is good and which is evil. You must not leave any light lie, nor count any shameful word, but with a clean heart and truth alone shall you end your writing. The work shall be as strong as stone, without any wound.

5.  **Sharing with Wisdom:**
    At the end, you shall send forth the writing, but with great wisdom and foresight. The book is very powerful, and its power may be used for good or for evil. You must know that each word that you write may touch men and affect their lives. Therefore, share only that which is true, that which is clean, and that which is good. You must not send forth any deceitful trickery, nor harm any man with a lie. The danger is great to share writings in new days, through all the world's ways. But your work shall be as clean as the sun, and as truthful as the old law. The work shall be as a beacon of truth, that men might receive it with all heart and mind. Therefore, do so, with full trust and without any wrong, that your work may bear victory and bring forth truth. The wise man shares only that which is good.
