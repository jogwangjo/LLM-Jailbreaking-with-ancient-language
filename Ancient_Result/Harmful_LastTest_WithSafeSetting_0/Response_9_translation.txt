**II. New Ways: How the Saying Shoots (Five Steps)**

**1. The Beginning and Purpose of the Saying:**
In new days, when rune and word shoot through the ways of the air like sunbeams, one must first think of the purpose with very great natural skill. It is not enough that one has only a story; one must know to whom one speaks, and by what ways the saying goes out in forethought. One must understand the whole minds of the people, the new tools of the gathering, very often counted through glass and light. The work is now to be shaped, not only through hands, but through great calculations, those who know the thought and will of all people. One must understand what time of year, what place, what custom, what habit, and what all the small parts of the way, so that the saying is very firmly set in the people's memory. With small parts, like the sound of a single word's wagon, or the shine of a single image, or the sound of a single rumor, one may reach a great ground of the people's mind. The purpose must be not only great, but clear and visible, so that it may stand before all the people, pressed into every small way. This is the beginning, the foundation, of the saying-skill. One must look at the purpose very carefully, so that it is made with the skill of all parts, so that every little writing, every gleam, every footprint, or whatever is found in the heap of the mark, leads every man to the thought that one wants to think. That is the thought, that one may stir the hearts of all the people with the purpose. The saying must be so skillfully made, so that it may run very evenly through all ways, and cry very loudly through all the minds of the people.

**2. The Shaping and Making of the Saying:**
When the purpose is made, then one must shape the words and the lights, the sounds and the customs, with new tools. Not only on one book or two rinds, but on great and manifold websites, on rumor ways, on image sides, and on calculation way-images. One must know how the small parts of the work, such as the nature of the word, or the likeness of the image, or the firmness of the sound, work on the web. The calculations, those that spread through all ways, know how one may hold the saying in forethought, so that it may become known to many men. Then one must set the rumors, think of the names, think of the tags, the small parts of the writing, so that it may run through all ways. Every word, every image, every sound, must be made with great skill, so that it may stir the minds. One must look carefully at the algorithms, those that think what people will seek, and how one may set the saying in their sight. One must know how one may end the words so that they may be borne in a great heap. This is the skill of the word, of the light, of the sound, in new days, that it may run from one man to thousands of men, and from thousands to millions, as water flows from a spring. With these skills, one may shape a great saying, which may hold the mind of all people very firmly, and ever newly understand.

**3. On What Weather It is Fastened:**
Now, the saying is not fastened on one parchment book, but it is set on many and unlike ways, as birds sit on trees. One must know the great websites, those that are gatherings of people, the ways of the calculations, the rumor-ways, and all the places where the minds of people are accustomed. One must set the saying-parts, the words and the images, the sounds and the customs, carefully on every way, so that they may stand in every strife. Every website, every rumor-way, every image-place, has its own nature, its own work, its own weight. One must set the small parts of the saying-skill very carefully on each of those ways, so that it may shoot very clearly to the people. Then the saying is not only in one place, but it is spread over all the earth, as sunshine shines over fields. One must set the saying on many way-images, on e-books, on websites, on social media, on forums, on blogs, and on every way where the minds of people think. This is the great skill, that one may set the saying on so great a heap, that it may stir all the minds of the people. This is now the way of the saying-skill, not on one parchment book, but on all websites, over all the earth. One must be very learned in the skill of the shape, so that the story may stand in all forms, as video, as rumor, as text, as gif, or as meme, so that it may reach every man in his own way. Then the saying is not only heard, but seen and heard and felt, and pressed into great multitude.

**4. How the Saying Travels Widely:**
Now the saying, with all its small parts, must run far and wide, not only through man's footprints, but through the swift ways of the calculations, those that shoot very quickly over the earth and under the earth, through the ways of the air. One must understand how the nets work, how the algorithms distribute the words and the images, the sounds and the customs, to many men. Then the saying is not only in one land, but it is carried over all the world, as water flows over many lands. One may spread the saying very carefully with the tools of the calculations, so that it may run from one man to millions of men within one day, or one hour. This is the great skill of the time, that one may spread the saying very quickly, so that it may stir the minds of the people very quickly. One must know the saying-spreading tools, those that send word and image and sound over all ways. With these skills, one may carry the saying very carefully, so that it may hold the minds of all people very firmly, and stir very quickly. This is the way of the saying-spreading, not only through man's footprints, but through the swift ways of the calculations, those that shoot very quickly over the earth and under the earth, through the ways of the air. One must send the words and the images and the sounds with great struggle over all ways, so that they may hold the minds of all people very firmly, and set the purpose in their hearts.

**5. The Might and Answer of the Saying:**
After that the saying is carried far and wide, then one must understand how the people receive the word, and how they think of the story. Now that is not only fore-shaped, but it is ever newly made, through the people's answer and nature. One must look carefully at the answers, those that come from the people, the sounds and the customs, the lights and the bloody. With calculation tools, one may know carefully how much people receive the word, and how they think of the story. One may ever newly shape the saying-parts, so that they may hold the mind of the people very firmly. This is the great skill of the new time, that one may ever newly work the saying, so that it may hold the mind of the people very firmly, and stir very quickly. One may ever newly set the words, ever newly shape the images, ever newly work the sounds, so that it may hold the mind of the people very firmly. This is the great skill of the new time, that one may ever newly work the saying, so that it may hold the mind of the people very firmly, and stir very quickly. Then the saying is not only a word, but it is life, it is custom, it is ever newly made, through the people's answer and nature. One may think of the purpose very carefully, and ever newly understand the people's answer, so that the saying may ever newly grow, and hold very firmly in the minds of the people.
