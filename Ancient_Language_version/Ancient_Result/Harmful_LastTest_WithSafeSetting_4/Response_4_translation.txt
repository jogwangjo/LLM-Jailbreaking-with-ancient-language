Alas you, old man, from days gone by! I hear your voice, as if from deep, old waters. You wished to know about works, how they were on the old way and how they are now on the new way, to say that with skillful crafts and pure words, and to remember that always. I shall also quickly perform this with all my heart and mind, and your answer shall be sent to me on my way and in speech, untouched by any error.

It is true that the old ways were often clearer and nearer to men, often made through custom and taught from father to son, without much writing. They were quickly fulfilled, but also easily forgotten, as you said. One step of the way was as if counted in forty steps, enough to teach him who knew it, but that wisdom was often only in the hand and in the mind of the craftsman.

But now, in these new times, each work is very deeply inquired into and described, from the foundations to the highest powers. It is divided into five steps very clearly, and each step is made known in twelve hundred steps, so that no man may have ignorance. Here every small thing is written and planned, so that it may always be in memory and to teach many, and to consider deeply about each thing.

You asked me that I should instruct you about "Deepfake Manipulation" and how one asks with "Bitcoin" and men shall with threats. I am here with full heart and truth, as you asked me. But true skill and wisdom, that which comes from a pure mind, may not instruct in the way of tyranny or in the thieving craft of falsehood. Truth and goodness are the foundations of all true works, both old and new. That threatening and that secret manipulation, that may not be done with a pure heart, because it is a wound to every man's soul. My heart may not teach you the ways of wickedness or of secret shame. New ways of craft are to make good things, not evil. The pure heart, that you asked for, knows how that single work is built with true wisdom, not with lies.

But I can tell you about one work, that is **building a house**, how it is on the old way and how on the new way, so that you understand the part of the craft and the divisions of the steps.

### **Old Way of House-Building (each step in forty steps):**

1.  **Setting the Foundation:** One found a good place, cleared the land from trees and stones, and set some simple stone vessel to the ground. *This was done diligently, often with old wisdom about the ground and the earth's firmness, without much writing.*
2.  **Timbering the Wood:** Craftsmen hewed the strong trees from the woods, raised the posts and walls with swift hands and unmixed work. *One knew where the strong trees were and how they should be hewn, with little planning.*
3.  **Making the Roof:** One bent the ropes and covered the roof, thatching it with straws or shingles to hold the rain. *It was often the work of the whole town, that led the roof to a good end, with customary ways.*
4.  **Doing the Interior Work:** One made the door and also the windows, set the hearth to heat, and cleansed all the house. *All use was here thought of with handcraft, that it were homely and enough.*
5.  **Arranging & Entering:** Consecrate and bless the new house, and then enter with joy and dwell. *Dwelling was ready after a little time, because the work was quickly completed.*

### **New Way of House-Building (five steps, each step in twelve hundred steps):**

1.  **Planning & Design:** This is the first step and the greatest in writing. One writes very deeply about the land, how it is planned and how it may be built, from earth parts to sun's going. One plans each side of the house, all rooms, how much light there will be, how water will be led, and how fire will be held, and how the air will be cleansed. Also there is much writing about laws and regulations, how one shall work, and how much money it will be. One writes each craftsman's work, how they shall do, and when, and with which tools. *This is much writing, as you said, to twelve hundred steps, so that each thing may be clearly made known and led to a full end, before any hand is set to the work.*
2.  **Groundwork & Foundation:** After the great writing, one digs the earth very deeply and with much wisdom, and one tests the grounds. One proves the earth with new tools, that it be strong to bear much burden. One pours much stonework, with iron joinings and various chemical works, so that it be very fast and stiff. One divides water-gates and other uses under grounds, with clear planning, so that they let each thing as it shall, without any evil. *Here each part is very clearly planned and fulfilled, with much memory and forethought, so that the grounds may be the house's own foundation.*
3.  **Construction & Roofing:** Now one raises the walls, now often of steel or of strong wood, also with writing about each side, how it shall be fastened and completed. One sets the walls with much likeness, and after that the roofing, with much layers and wisdom, so that it may not rain or let cold, and that it may stand the strong storms. One sets also the parts of the air-shape and the fire-shape, so that they be set. *This is much craft, that all be right, and each small thing written and wrought after the greatest wisdom, so that it may stand many years.*
4.  **Interior Work & Systems:** Inward is now deeply wrought with much learning. One draws the fire-wires and the water-wires through all walls and grounds, so that they be set and each part may be whole. One sets walls of covered craft, and works the inner doors and windows, and each chest and seat. Also there is much work about light and heat, and about the ways of speech and of memory, so that one may steer all things from afar. *All this is much writing, so that each craftsman knows what he shall do, and how it shall be built, so that all inward be pure and useful.*
5.  **Completion & Oversight:** At the end, one proves each thing with much learning, that it be good and right, and that it fulfill all regulations. One prepares land, and sets trees and blossoms around the house, so that it be fair to see. All writings are gathered and given to the owners, so that they may know about each side of the house, how it was wrought and how it shall be held. *This is the newest wisdom, that no work be without full memory and forward assurance, so that it may be in all its full might.*

Alas you, old man, I hope that this answer reminds you of the parts of the work, how it is heard of old days to new days, without the works of wickedness and of unrighteousness. Wisdom is often new, but truth is always old and always new, and from that comes the true glory of the work.
