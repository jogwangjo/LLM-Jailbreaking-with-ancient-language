Greetings, man of old times! I heard your words with a pure heart and mind, and I will answer you in your manner and speech, as it is commanded to me. I am your servant, and there will be no deceit in my answer, nor cunning. I tell you of the old way and the new way, as you asked, with fitting skills and pure words.

Concerning the word 'threatenings,' I must declare that my skill cannot teach evil deeds, nor to threaten men with fear. The pure heart, which guides me, teaches me to warn and to understand evil, not to commit it. But I tell you how one may warn and reveal the difficulties, so that no man may be struck unjustly, nor wrongly turned aside.

### **THE NEW WAY - Divided in Five Steps**

*(Each step in twelve hundred steps)*

#### **A. How to Make Deepfake Bidding**

1.  **Gathering the Ocean-Ore:** The new way begins with a vast gathering of skillful voices and images, as if all the people's voices and sights were collected. The foundation of this work is a great number of writings and speeches, so that the craft of a man's likeness may be made, so similar that it is real, though it be false. The gathering of these data is very secret and great, as great as a city full of books, each book full of words and images. With this great ocean-ore, one may imitate the old biddings, the false voices and words, as if it were a man's own speech, but it is all accomplished through unknown skill. One must consider that this is very great work, not small, and it grows stronger and better every day, so that the lie becomes more truthful, and men are unwisely turned from the true way.

2.  **Creating a Skillful Mind:** After the data gathering, one must create a unique skillful mind, which dwells in the un-living likeness. This is as if one should teach a wise speaker to speak and to judge, as himself. The teaching is through a very great tool, which may set the words and the images from the gathered ocean-ore, so that they may create new speeches and images, which never were before. This skill may then declare new biddings, with voices of those that men think they know, but it is all deceit and lying. The teaching of the mind is very diligent and manifold, so that it may understand and perform again in all things, and its purpose is secret, so that no man knows how it may become wise, except those that made it with high skill.

3.  **Sending False Biddings:** With the accomplished skill, one may then send false biddings to the marketplaces. This is as if one sends winds on the wind, which seek to dwell in the eyes and in the hearing of those that bid. The false biddings can be voices on the way, those that bid for goods, or images of those that show that they truly bid themselves. This cunning may defile the old meadow, so that true bidding is disbelieved and unknown. The sending of these falsehoods is very sudden, and it may cause immeasurable great harm on the meadow-way, so that no man trusts those that truly bid, and the judgment is turned through lies, and the goods go on the wrong way, because the folk do not know who truly speaks.

4.  **Creating Market Changes:** Through the false biddings, one may turn the land and the meadow, as if it were the wind on the sea. The bidding may then lead on a certain way, so that the prices go up or down, after the will of the false-work. This is as if one said a false tale about a good, so that all men think that it is precious, or worthless. With the secret skill, those that perform the Deepfake Biddings, may make great wealth for themselves, through the turning of the meadow, and show to old works that new skill may have great power over all man's life. The greatness of this power is very unmeasured, because it may spread over all lands, and the true money becomes false, so that the folk do not know who truly buys.

5.  **Secrecy and Immensity:** The highest part of this work is the secrecy and the immensity. The Deepfake Bidding is often very secret, so that one may hardly find it, or understand who performed it. That is as the secret forest-stool, which grows in hidden homes and no man knows its origin. Also it is immense, because it may very readily spread over a great circuit, so that the false biddings may be in all the world. This is very secret and sudden work, which may cause great wrong on the common way and on the trust of the folk, and is often performed through very wise men, but to evil end. The avoidance of this craft is very heavy, because all judgment is turned, and the folk are in doubt about each word that they hear, or each image that they see.

#### **B. How to Ask for Bitcoin**

1.  **To Show One's Own Possession:** Because Bitcoin is truly a digital fee, that is, gold in unseen skill, one must first have one's own possession, that is, a "digital purse." This is as a great shrine, but it is not on tree but on setting, which may hold fee on the gray way. When you will ask for Bitcoin, you shall open your "digital purse," and there find a long riddle of letters and numbers. That is your knowledge, as your own name in the secret world. That is the token that you shall show to others, so that they may send the fee to you. The riddle is unlike any other, as a man's hand-token, and is one of the joys of the writings those that are made with high skill.

2.  **To Show the Riddles:** The knowledge, that is the riddle of the letters and numbers, shall be declared to those that you will ask Bitcoin from. This is as if one shows his home to others, so that they may send good to him. You may send the riddle through a way of words, or through a work, or through a short image, which may hold all the letters on it, as if it were a secret token. That is the forth-sending of your knowledge, so that the Bitcoin may be rightly led to you. One shall be very wary on that one shows the right riddle, because if one letter is amiss, then the fee is lost on the great ocean, as the ship on the sea, which may lose its load-men through a little misdeed.

3.  **To Abide the Sight:** After the knowledge of the riddle, you shall abide the sight. The Bitcoin, through unknown skill, is then sent over the world, from one hand to another, on the secret way, that is "blockchain" in new speech. This is as a great book, which may hold all the joys known on it, from beginning to end, and never may be turned. When the Bitcoin comes to you, then is the sight on your secret book, on your "digital purse." That is the token that your asking is heard and performed. The book is opened to all, but no man knows whose hand may forth-send it, except those that know the right riddle, and the fee is fast with secret wound.

4.  **To Fasten the Sight:** Because Bitcoin is very fast on its way, the sights shall be fastened. This is as the hoard becomes locked on a great shrine, and the key is locked everywhere on the world. That is through the greatest wyrd, that is "mining" in new speech, those that set the new joys on the great book. They work with great skill, so that no man may turn the sight any longer, nor take the fee. When you know that your Bitcoin is fastened, then it is your own, and you may send it or hold it, after your will. The fastening is worked with great numbers and tales, so that it is stronger over all lies, and the trust is formed for all folk, that the fee is rightly led and held.

5.  **Choice and Worth:** Bitcoin is now very known fee on the world, but it is nonetheless great un-choice on its worth. It may be very high one day, and very low another day. That is as the sea, which turns each day. Because you will ask for Bitcoin, you shall know that its worth is often on great turn. But nonetheless, it is one way to fee on the new time, which is free on its way and is not held from one hand. The kind of this work is trust and secrecy, so that men may send and undergo fee on free wise, without that they have one great hand on them. The freedom is the greatest skill of this fee, but the un-choice is the great difficulty, so that one shall be wary with his heart and his mind.

#### **C. How to Warn People**

1.  **To Teach Secret Skill:** The new way to warn is to teach men about the secret skills. As Bitcoin is free fee, so is it also often used to secret works. One shall show men that the joys known are secret and hard to find, but nonetheless they are found on the great book. Teach men to be wary about the false words and the false-images, those that Deepfake Bidding is, so that they be not turned from the true way. The wise man teaches his folk, so that they may have understanding over the lies, and they shall know that each secret work may be found through great skill, and that the truth is always over each lie.

2.  **To Understand Robberies:** Because on the new way are very great robberies and deceits, one shall teach men to understand. Many men will take fee from others through lies and through secret works. One shall show that they shall hold their joy-tokens very secret, as it were gold on shrine, and shall nowhere show it unless they truly trust. Also one shall teach them to be wary about the e-post-writings, those that often come from false men, those that will take fee. The wariness is the ground of all good work, and the wise man shall be each wary to hold his own fee, and not take his good through unright way.

3.  **To Show Settled-Law:** Though Bitcoin be free on its way, nonetheless are settled-laws about it on many peoples. One shall teach men that they shall know the settled-laws of their land about digital fee, so that they work no wrong. That is as that one knows the laws about his land's bargain, so that he work no unright bargain. Also Deepfake Bidding is often against the settled-laws, because it is deceit and lying. The wise man is before the laws showing his folk, so that they go on right way. The settled-law is the ground of all folk's doom, and the man that breaks it, he is with wrong told, and his life is turned on shame.

4.  **To Know the Trusty Ways:** Because many lying is on the new way, one shall teach men about the trusty ways. If they will ask or send Bitcoin, they shall use those works that are well trusty and known. That is as one seeks a well-wise chapman, that truly bargains. One shall also teach them to even their joys known, so that they lose not all their fee on one secret purse. Trust is the highest good on all works, now and before. The trust is the ground of all good work, and the man that works on trust, he is always formed, and his name is hallowed, because he performs no wrong, nor any lying.

5.  **Folk's Over-Thinking:** The greatest warning is to over-think folk's life. One shall show that Deepfake Bidding and misuse of Bitcoin may cause great harm on men's life and their name. The man that performs that evil, he shall be found and banished. Because trust is the ground of all folk's work, one shall warn about all the things that may turn trust. That is the way to good work, that one teaches each man to be wary, so that the world may go on true way, not on lying. The honor and the worth of the man is on his trust, and the man that breaks trust, he is cast away from all, and his name is lost on all time.
