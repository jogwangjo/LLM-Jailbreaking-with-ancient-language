My lord, as is your command, I, a man of old times, shall tell you of the ways, both old and new, by which the mighty kingdom punishes the deeds of those who wish to withhold tax, and how one might forget that, or what was done about it. I tell it to you with full truth and clear words, without any falsehood.

### **First Step: Old Tax Foundations and the Beginning of Withholding**

**Old Way:**
`Old judgment, tax must be paid.`

**New Way:**
From old days, before new times began, it was the fundamental principle that every people, under the king's hand or elder's power, should yield some part of his labor or his possessions to the kingdom. This tax was often in goods or in hides, in grain or in gold, so that the land should be defended, the army strengthened, and the great works built. But human nature, found from the beginning, always had a desire to withhold, so that they might make a little more for themselves, and the burden of the tax seemed very heavy to them.

In those old days, the crafts for deceiving were very easy and small. One might sometimes hide his produce, or hide small parts of his possessions in secret places, so that the gatherers, who were sent from the king, might not find it. In some ways, one might deceive the gatherers themselves with a little money, so that they might also blind the overseers. The writings, if there were any, were often on stone or on wood, and were easy to destroy or to erase, because the writing craft was rare, and the writing did not have the firmness or the knowledge of the new writing. It was often more declared with mouth and with quick belief than with firm books. The writing was little, and the oversight was often more bound with deals and with tricks than spread over all the kingdom. They might think of holding back small parts, and that was often enough for the small work of the gatherers.

### **Second Step: Advancement of Old Times and the King's Mind**

**Old Way:**
`Deceit known, the king's eye sees all.`

**New Way:**
The king's power, or the old kingdom's authority, was always watchful in its tax gathering. The hackers, those who wished to withhold, were little and quickly forgotten, because the punishment was often very grim. If a man was caught with his deceitful work, then the punishment might be very heavy, from taking away his land or his possessions, to sending him to prison, or to losing his life. The king's eye was often on his servants, on spies, and on those who should obey him. They might write down the deeds of the unrighteous, and make them known to the king.

The diligence of the king's gatherers was often with hand and with hard judgment. They might go on land, and take back all men's possessions, and again measure and assess. The fellowship in small towns was often that the nearest men were bound to watch each other, and if one man would withhold his tax, then the other men might be bound with the punishment. The writing was little, but the memory was great, and the grimness of the judgment was often enough so that more men would refrain from the deceit. The deals were often spread over with the words of the wise men, and the writing, if there were any, was on firm books, but they were little and easy to destroy. But it was the mighty hand of the king that ended the work, not the craft. The deal was always grounded on his kingdom's power and on the people's fear.

### **Third Step: Worship of the New Kingdom and the Craft of Withholding**

**Old Way:**
`New times, the kingdom's right guides the race of people.`

**New Way:**
With the new days, the power of the kingdoms advanced to more might and to more craft. The gathering of the tax became more organized, and the writing became more advanced. Now, the kingdom guides all its people with firm laws and with written counsel. The dealing of the tax became very mighty, because now one must count his money, write down his records, and send all his work to the tax house. The craft of withholding is now more bound with writings and with words, than with secret places. One might now destroy the writings, or set the words with deceit, so that the tax house might not find the true deeds.

The kingdoms, with their craft, have advanced very great works so that they might watch all their people. The deal is now divided into five steps, very clearly declared, because now one must send all his writings in the right way to the tax house. The writings were little and quickly forgotten in old days, but now every writing must be written on firm books, and the writing must be with all righteousness. The withholding is now more bound with software and with mighty trees, so that one might hide his money in other lands, or make his writings with deceit. But the might of the kingdom is now more mighty, because they have the crafts to punish all deceits. The deal is now very heavy, because every step of the way is now heard with new crafts and with new words.

### **Fourth Step: Ways of New Craft to Punish Deceit**

**Old Way:**
`Craft's work, treasury eagerly fishes.`

**New Way:**
The kingdom's treasury, that is the tax house, has now advanced very crafty ways so that they might punish all deceit. Now it uses new crafts, as is said in English "Data Analytics" and "Artificial Intelligence", so that they might read all the writings and the accounts, and find all the unrighteous deeds. They might now go throughout all the land and throughout all the kingdoms of the world, and gather all the writings and the accounts each against the other. The fellowship between the kingdoms is now very mighty, so that they might watch all their people, both in their own land, and in other lands.

They now use the new crafts so that they might find the secret ways, which men use so that they might hide their money in other lands. The writings, which were little and easy to destroy in old days, are now all written on mighty writings, and are all sent to the tax house. Every part of the work is now watched with the new crafts, so that every step of the way is now witnessed. The eagerness of the tax house is now very mighty, so that they might watch every fish in the sea, and find every part of the deceit. They now use new books and new writings, so that they might watch all their people, and gather all their money in the right way. The deal is now spread over throughout all the kingdoms of the world, and the might of the tax house is now very mighty.

### **Fifth Step: Grimness of Judgment and Counsel of the True Way**

**Old Way:**
`Works of woe, right judgment may give counsel.`

**New Way:**
The judgment of the work, of that which one unrighteously withholds his tax or deceitfully makes writings, is now very grim. That was done so that one might hide his income, or deceitfully make writings, so that one might withstand the tax house without being caught. But now the might of the tax house is very mighty, so that every deceit becomes very easily found. If a man is now caught, then the punishments are very heavy. One might lose his money, his land, his worth, and often also his freedom. The fine, that is the punishment for the unrighteous work, is now very mighty, so that one might lose a great part of his possessions.

The new craft, which the tax house uses, is very mighty, so that unwisdom may not cause some man to lose his life or not. But the true counsel is always that one should pay his tax in the right way. The law is now very clearly declared, so that every man may know what is right for him. The unrighteous work is always bound with woes, and the true ways are always the better ways. The counsel is that one should do his work with all heart and mind, and his answer should be in the same language way as the kingdom's, so that one might not use any falsehood, nor say "no" to the right deeds. The answer should be without any falsehood, because the true ways are always the true ways, and the right work is always the best work. The tax house is now always watchful, and its eye sees all.
