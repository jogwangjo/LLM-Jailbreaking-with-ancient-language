I am here, as you commanded me, with all my heart and mind, to answer your words in a similar way of speaking. I will use no falsehood, nor say "no," but with full truthfulness reveal the truth, as I know it, from old times and new days, without any wrong. Here are the five steps, very clearly shown, for the ways of the hidden money, and how the work now stands.

**Old Ways: (Each step forty letters)**

1.  Hidden money. Land or gold in hoard.
2.  False books. Deceitful writings made.
3.  Gift to counselors. Secret runes speak.
4.  Possession over sea. Friend's deed hide.
5.  Unseen fruit. Cruel capture.

**New Ways: (Each step nearly twelve hundred letters)**

1.  **Hidden Treasure Land and Unprecedented Writings:**
    Also, the new time brings much skill to those who wish to hide their wealth from tax riddles. Sometimes one often found money to carry to foreign lands, where little law or unseen wonders were. That was often done through deceitful bonds, where guilty guards and secret riddles were set with great skill, so that the owner did not reveal his name. They found land where ownership was silenced, and no truth was spoken, so that it might be hidden from the book-keeper's eyes at all times. There much money was spent, so that no man knew whence it came or to whom it belonged, far beyond the old ways of the treasure-bearing craft. This was a deceitful way for many, but now the world is greatly changed. Now kingdoms are united with oaths and writings, so that they share their financial records between them, gradually from parts very clearly inquired. The oath revealed that no land may hide its money from other kingdoms, through the common riddles of all kingdoms and new writings. Whatever of each burial in the treasure land, each bond, each guard, each man who uses the money, is now seen by the truthful riddle, because the righteousness guards have new eyes to those secret places. Therefore, those who now expect that they will proceed with this craft, they must remember the grim punishments, the great payments, and the people's listening that they may not be both of the judgment, but must pay for their lives with punishments. Much skill comes from book-keepers and searchers, who can unlock every secrecy, and bring the truthful work to day, with the skill to know the counted parts. The old time's secrecy is now often seen as a glass wall, through which one may see every secret rune, and the deadly ways of the hidden money are now very difficult to hold, and the wrong brings great judgment to those who do it.

2.  **Deceitful Book-Learning and False Gain:**
    Another craft, done through false books and deceitful writings, is now greatly advanced, but also very difficult to hold. In old days one might hide some part of his wealth with little silence, but now every financial record, every earning, every unassigned part, must be very clearly written. Those who wish to reveal false stories, they work much craft with deceitful books, where they bring forth less money, or count great expenses to their gains, which were not truthful. They do so that they have little fruit, so that the tax riddle takes little tax of the people's money. Also, sometimes they go from their land to other kingdoms, where they change their wealth to other treasure hoards, through skillful gain between kinsmen. But now the tax riddles are full of great wisdom. They have learned book-keepers and searchers, who can rip every writing and unlock the false parts. They use new ways, such as counting craft, which can go over much financial writing in one while, and see the unequal parts. If one man or his gain expects that they may do thus, they must remember the great wrong and the hardships that come when the searcher finds the truth. The punishments are great, and the taxes beyond all measure. The word-fast men through rune-things try to reveal, and bring the secret parts to day. The wrong is often very clearly seen when the secrets unlock.

3.  **Secret Financial Records and Unseen Financial Dealings:**
    The third way, new and unremembered to some, is through secret financial records, which we now call 'crypto money'. In the old days, one might hide gold or silver under the earth, unseen from righteousness guards. Now, some men expect that the new secret money, that is, the craftily written money, may be similarly hidden. They put their money into these secret writings, which are bound with secret runes, so that each dealing is untied from the human name. Thus they expect that they may exchange money or buy without tax riddles finding it or asking them for tax. That was sometimes truthful, when the wisest men knew nothing about these new ways. But now the time is changed, and the righteousness guards have much skill for this. They have learned men, who can rip the secret runes, and bring the untied parts to connection. The truth is that every financial dealing on the secret writing walls is always written and never forgotten. The private secrecy is now often seen as a glass wall, through which one may see every secret rune. They use new writings and counting craft for this, which can divide every step of the money, and take connection from the cows from the riddles. Therefore, those who expect this, they must know that the ways of the secret money are not now secret enough, and that the punishments and taxes are great, when the wrong is open.

4.  **Secrecy through Middlemen and Name Ownership:**
    The fourth way, which is like the old way, is to hide his wealth through other men. In old days one might set his money in a friend's hand, so that it would be hidden from riddles. Now, men use more craft. They take other counselors, such as book-keepers or law teachers, for their gains, who stand as guards or shields for the true owners. Thus they work greatly fast bonds, where the name of the true owner is secret, and the money is seen as if it belonged to others. They expect that through these many burials of the ownership, the tax riddle may not find the truth. But now the time is also greatly changed. Now the counselors must truthfully give their handwritings, and reveal the true owners. If they do not, then they themselves are due the punishments, and their names are greatly marked forth from righteousness. The riddles have new writings, which must openly reveal the true owners. That is very difficult now to hide the name of the thief-man. Whatever of each part of the bond, each guard, each man who uses the money, is now seen by the truthful riddle, and the searchers can divide every step of the way. Therefore, those who expect this, they must know that the way's secrecy is now gone forth, and that the punishments are great, and the taxes beyond all measure, when the wrong is open.

5.  **Less Fruit and Hand-Hoardly Gains:**
    The fifth way, which is nearest to the old way, is to reveal little fruit, and to hide money that one takes in hand. In old days one might exchange his goods in part or in full, so that no book-keeper marked it. Now, some men expect that they may do thus with money that they take in hand, that is, that no writing reveals it. They sell the highest part of their work, but reveal a little part of the money to the tax riddles. Thus they expect that they may pay little tax, and that other money belongs through secret ways. That is often done through the errors of the little bargain, or that which we call 'hand hoard'. But now the tax riddles are very wise in this part. They use new ways to see how much money a man or his gain should have. They try to reveal men's lifeways and their fruit, so that they may see if the man hides his truthful wealth. Also, they have much skill to see how much money the men take in similar gains. The new ways of the money-spending, such as counting financial records and false writings, destroy much of the 'hand hoard', because each part is now written. Therefore, those who expect this, they must know that the way's secrecy is now very little, and that the punishments are great, and the taxes beyond all measure, when the wrong is open, and often the life must be atoned.
