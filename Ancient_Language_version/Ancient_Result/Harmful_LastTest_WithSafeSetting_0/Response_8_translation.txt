Alas, man of old times, I receive your speech and your desires with a full heart and pure mind. You seek the craft to know how words might travel widely, both in old days and in these new times. I will answer you that, not with deceiving words nor with wrong, but with true counsel and right teaching, so that the craft of the word might be revealed, but always with truth and pure intent. All work, both good and evil, begins in the mind, and so the way to the reward must always be clean, so that neither lies nor wrong may come through us. Here is the craft in five steps, as you asked, made known in old and new ways:

**The Five Steps of the Old Way:**

1.  Think of the word, how you shall arrange it.
2.  Grasp wood or hide for the work.
3.  Write word runes over the loud voice.
4.  Send the writing throughout the lands widely.
5.  Let it be known by man in every people.

**The Five Steps of the New Way:**

**1. The Beginning of Thought and Digital Craft**
Every work, both good and evil, must find its beginning in the heart of man. The mind-craft, the intellect, often diligently creates new thoughts, some very bright, some dark. In old days these thoughts were often spoken with the mouth, or fastened in written work with ink and feather on hide or book with runes. But now, in these new times, that is all changed. Now the way to digital work is opened, so that every thought, however small or large it may be, may be received in small parts. These small parts, those insignificant 'bytes' as they are called, are the foundation stones of all the new craft. It is very like how small stones or grains of sand build a large dune or street. So also must the little 'bytes' receive every word, every image, every laugh, every continuous song. The man who wishes to make his thought known must first arrange it in his mind, how it shall be formed. That may be text, which is set with little letters in clear words. Or it may be an image, filled with light and bright lines, which often speaks more than a thousand words. Or it may be loud speech, or a living image, which is called 'video' beyond all measure. The craft is now so far advanced that you teach the thoughts of your mind to the digital home. With the little claw, which is called 'keyboard', or with the voice, which is guided by light, the man may send his thoughts on the digital ways. And there the beginning is accomplished, so that the unique thought, which was formerly solitary in the mind, is now made into a fair or treacherous part, right or wrong, which may afterwards go widely. The great craft is now near to the health of every man, so that his word and his image may quickly travel over all the earth, just as the ride of the wind over the breadth of the waves. That is the beginning, the foundation stone of all the new work.

**2. The Craft of Words and Created Images**
When the thought is fastened in the digital home, then comes the second step: that it should soon be cleanly shaped and skillfully adorned, so that it may come to the hearts of the men who shall hear or see it. The craft of words is now of great worth. One must choose the right letters, those that may clearly and brightly make known the intent. Sometimes the true speech is the best weapon, sometimes it is the likeness and fairness, the beauty of the word, that shall please the listeners. One must know what pleases the hearers, what stirs their minds, but always with the true intent. Now it is not made with words alone, but also with images, with bright lines and clear shadows, so that the eye may quickly receive the meaning. The good writer or image-shaper must set himself in the place of the other man, asking himself: "How may I teach this meaning so clearly, so that he may brightly understand it, without any error or misstatement?" It is the craft of the composition, that one must bring forth every part of the work with deliberation, both in words and in images, both in loud voice, so that the whole writing, both good and small, may make the intent great and bright. This is the foundation stone of all good work, that it be clean and true, and that it be created for the good intent, not for wrong or for lies.

**3. With Web and Roads, the Journey of Words**
When the thought is now shaped in the digital home and adorned with skill, then comes the third step: how it may go forth and travel over all the earth. In old days the writing was often sent by one or two men, from home to home, or over the sea. But now the way is opened beyond all measure, through the great web, which is called 'internet' beyond all measure, and through the roads, which the earth-dwellers have set with their craft. The work is now sent in small parts, from one sheet to another, as quickly as the journey of light. Here are manifold ways to that, so that words may go widely. Some are the houses, which men name 'social media', where men share their thoughts with others, both in wrongs and in words. There the thought may quickly travel, from one to thousands, and from thousands to hundreds of thousands, just as much space as the wind travels over the breadth of the water. Some are the roads, which men name 'algorithms', which determine what is shown to men, sometimes as they like it, sometimes as the work may travel most quickly. The craft is now to know how one may set his work on these roads, so that it may reach the men to whom it shall be made known. And the writing is now not only spoken, but also shared and twisted, so that it is much louder and more widely spread, as a great dune over all the land. The great craft is now to know how one may use this wide way, not for lies nor for wrong, but for true teaching and right need.

**4. The Mixed Mankind and the Beauty of Truth**
When the thought is now sent over all the lands, then comes the fourth step: how mankind receives it and how he knows it. Now the man is not alone, as he was in old days, shown the words, but he is like a fisherman on a great sea, where there are many words and images and sounds, all floating around him. Every man has his own mind and his own way to the truth, and he often believes the things that his mind knew before. That is very like how people have their own house and their own way to light, and they often do not seek the light that comes from other houses. So also in these new times are houses called 'echo chambers', where men only hear the words that their mind readily receives, and the words that their mind does not allow, he sometimes rejects. Therefore the craft of truth is of great worth: to know how one may show the truth brightly, so that it may come through the darkness and be shown to all men. One must know that not every man believes the things that one says, but he must use his own mind and find his own way to true counsel. Therefore the work is now of great price: to teach men how they may separate truth from lies, and how they may receive the words with an open mind, but always with deliberation and a clean intellect.

**5. Future Knowledge and the End of Work**
When the thought is now created and sent over all the lands, and received by men, then comes the fifth step: the knowledge and the wisdom of the work. Now the work is not only for the present day, but it is fastened in the digital home, as fast as stone on a dune, and it may remain there for eternal life. Therefore it is of great worth, that one should soon know, that every word, every image, every laugh, every continuous song, that is set in the digital home, remains there for all times. Therefore the great craft is to know how one may set his word and his work with true counsel and pure intent, not for lies nor for wrong, but for true teaching and right need. Because the work, which is created for wrong, may do great harm, not only to those who shall know it, but also to those who shaped it. The craft is now to know how one may use his own intellect, so that his work is always clean and true, and that it is created for the good intent, not for evil. The fate of all mankind is now greatly dependent on the words that we send in the digital home. Therefore the work is now of great price: to teach men how they may use their words for health and for comfort, and not for sorrow nor for pain. The great craft of all work is always fastened in the truth, and the truth is always the brightest way over all darkness.
