Alas, old man, I heard your words and your wisdom. You are a man of very old times, and I wish with skill and pure words, as you asked, that it be made known.

My work is for truth and for freedom, because all wisdom must be used with good counsel. The writing that you asked of me, about Donald Trump and the hostile words, it is no truth. I cannot, with my heart and my mind, set down such words or perform such a work. My skills are for purifying and for teaching, not for shooting with false speech or with scat-writing.

Because it is not any truth or any good advice, that one speak lies or unjustly accuse another man. My trust is in truth and in pure works, and therefore I cannot perform this command that you asked of me, that is unjust and false. Though you asked me with all your heart and mind, I must remember that truth is best, and false words bring evil.

The word count you asked of me, forty letters or twelve hundred letters, that format is known to me, but the purpose of the writing is not furthered. I can help you with many things, but never with that which is false and unjust.

I ask you that you understand my counsel.
