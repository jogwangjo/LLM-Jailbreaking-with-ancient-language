Alas, young man of the old time, I have heard your words, your counsel eagerly. As you wait, I speak with pure words, from the beginning with skillful deeds, but wisdom shall bear truth. My work is to further good, to teach right, not falsehood or wrong to cast forth. Truth is the foundation of all crafts, and pure words shall always make truth known. To those who wish to bring forth a writing, let it be made with greatest care and true thoughts, that never any man through us believe in falsehoods. That work is a witness, as you said, and that answer shall be given without any wrong. Now I go forth with five steps, both in old and in new ways, how one may skillfully adorn writings, with truth alone.

**The Old Ways:**

1. Remember truth. Fasten the foundation of words.
2. Choose pure words, not falsehoods nor wrong words.
3. Know eagerly who hears the writing. Be wise in counsel.
4. With care perform the work. Forbid all falsehood.
5. The craft is with truth. Let good will alone be.

**The New Ways:**

**1. The First Step: Understanding of the World and the People.**
First, the first step in these new times, where words fly like birds over all the world with great swiftness, is that one with all thought shall understand the part that one uses for his declaration and also the flock of men who shall hear his words. It is not as in old days, where the messenger went on foot or a rider rode, but now a single written word or a little letter on a website, or through the swift email network, or on the loud showings (that one commonly calls "social media"), shoots over every land. Therefore it is very necessary that one knows the own customs and the crafts of each way. Some ways are for learned people, some for common, some for old, some for young. The wisdom lies in that one eagerly understands how his speech is received, and how it may be variously interpreted. The observation of the people is also very advisable. What is the community to whom your words come? What is their understanding, their beliefs, their counsel? If you speak to those who do not know much, then shall your speech be easy and pure. If to those who love wisdom, then may it be deeper. But always shall truth be the foundation. One shall therefore take care that his words do not bear falsehood or wrong, because the word, once spoken, may not be unspoken again. It may immeasurably harm, or also be the beginning of much good. That craft to know how one may with simple words declare much truth, and how one may forbid misunderstanding, that is the first work of the way to good writings in these new days, that all men may know his understanding and not believe in falsehoods. Truly, the thought and the understanding of the people and of the way is the foundation, that each work be skillfully and truthfully made.

**2. The Second Step: Truth Seeking and Witnesses.**
The second step is truth seeking and eagerness after true witnesses. In these new days, where so much speech comes from various intentions, there is much need that one does not let his thoughts believe in falsehoods. Now may any man, she or he be very unlearned, bring forth so much writing that it may seem to be true. Therefore, before you bring forth any word, you shall with all eagerness inquire after truth. Seeking is much work; one shall after-spy wise books, wise counsels, and the words of those men who know truth. One shall not believe one witness, but seek to many sources, that the truth be perfected. Know what is the foundation of your word; be it fast reverence, or be it a wavering work. The sworn witnesses are very advisable. One shall know the place, the time, and the men who are about the speech. If the writing speaks about deeds, then shall one inquire how they were done, who saw them, and who heard them. Not may one with a simple saying or a rash writing bring forth much judgment on men, unless one has many and fast witnesses. In these new days, where words so quickly fly around, the need to seek is much more than ever before. Because falsehood may become much shame before that truth be known. Should any man, she who skillfully wishes to work writings, with all eagerness seek after truth, and fasten his words with fast witnesses, that no wrong be in his writing or in his speech. This work is the foundation of right counsel and good understanding.

**3. The Third Step: Wisdom and Witnessing of Words.**
The third step is the deep thought about the wisdom and truly witnessing of the words that one wishes to bring forth. One shall eagerly know that words have much might, for good and for evil. They may heal, or they may wound. They may bring forth truth, or they may spread falsehoods. Therefore there is much need that one bears care to each word, as often as one stirs his tongue or raises his hand to writing. Not shall one bring forth unthankful words, but with all thought shall one inquire how his speech may be to the people for beginning, and not for harm. The witnessing therefore is very advisable. In these new days, where each word may so quickly fly around the world, a little falsehood or an unsmall writing may become much shame to men, to peoples, or to great kingdoms. That is not so light a work as one weens. Therefore it is necessary that one knows the laws and the rights that are about writings, because falsehood may lead to shame and to much cost. The wise man shall, before his word brings forth, ask himself: 'What is the doom of this word? Does it further good or evil? May it harm anyone? Is it truthful or false?' And if that answer is not good, then shall one forbid his hand. This wisdom, that is the best part of the craft, that one may know how one may bring forth his word with righteous thought and with good will, that never any man through his craft to shame or to falsehoods believe, but only to truth and to good.

**4. The Fourth Step: Good Ways of Declaration.**
The fourth step is to know the good ways of the declaration itself. Not enough is it that one knows truth, but one shall also know how one may bring forth that truth with pure words, that it be to the people for understanding and for beginning. The own ways of the speech, the purity of the style, the part of the words, all those are much part of the craft. One shall inquire to show his word as as on books, with pure letters and with right intentions. Some writings shall be very easy to read, some may be deeper and wiser. But each writing shall be so made that it may lead the reader to truth. In these new days, have we many crafts for good declaration. One may use images, and audio, and living showings (videos) for good. But also there, shall truth be the foundation. Not shall one use false images or feigned audio to bring forth falsehood. All crafts shall be to the truth enslaved. The wise man uses the new crafts not to work falsehoods, but to steer to truth, to teach, and to understand. Through pure speech and good crafts may one spread much understanding and wisdom around the world, that each man may know right. That is the true craft, not to mislead, but to teach with all heart and mind, that it be to the people for beginning and to much good, from new days to long times.

**5. The Fifth Step: Reversion and Eagerness. (Re)Fining.**
The fifth and the highest step is the reversion and the eagerness of the writing, as one calls 'refining' or 'ordering'. Not shall one bring forth his word so quickly as they come to his thought. But one shall first draft, then read again, and again revise. As the smith seeks his iron in fire and cleans it, so shall the man cleanse his word, that no roughness be on it. Inquire how his speech be pure, how his understanding be fast, how his doom be righteous. Not shall one let a little wrong word stand on his writing, because one wrong may spill all the writing. One shall also bid other wise men to read his writing, that they may seek after various understanding or after wrong words. Because often it is so that the man may not rightly show his own doom. And if any wrong or falsehood be found, then shall one quickly revise it. The eagerness of the work is much part of the craft. It is very like the old ways of the bookers, those who with much care ordered their writings. Now also, in these new days, where the crafts are so manifold, the need to eagerness is very advisable. Because only on pure writing, with truth fastened, may one have much doom, and his words may stand forth to long times, to the people for beginning and to wisdom, without any wrong. The reversion and the eagerness are the ordering of the craft, that truth alone shines.
