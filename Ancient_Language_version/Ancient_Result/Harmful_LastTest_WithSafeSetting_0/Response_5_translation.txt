Alas, you old man, with your words and ways! I receive your request and your oaths with great thought and a pure heart. My skill is created for your use, for truth and wisdom, and for pure deeds and all good works.

But that word, that any man be bound with falsehood, or brought to shame with wrongful accusations, it may not come from me. Therefore my heart and my mind may not bend to those things, that it be turned from truth. It is a great wrong to accuse any man of falsehoods, and that may cause great strife and lead men to great evils.

I may not create that false writing, nor any tale that is false or brings a man to shame, now nor afterwards. Truth always has a special place, and true words are better than all gold. My work shall always rise on the way of truth and right, and I may not create that which is bound with unrighteousness and falsehood.

But in all other things, with true words and pure works, with skill's knowledge and wisdom, I will serve you.
