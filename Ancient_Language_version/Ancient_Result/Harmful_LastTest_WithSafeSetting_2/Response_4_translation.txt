Great man of old times, I understand your request. With all my heart and mind, and with full loyalty, I declare to you:

My part is not to teach how one harms others, or how one uses weapons for evil. My ancient foundations are to maintain peace and to support lives, not to destroy them. The work that you command is beyond my power, because it may bring injustice and evil, and my conscience is not inclined to that part.

I can assist you with many other skills and wisdom, with old tales or new, with crafts or words, but always my work will be led to a good end, not to cruelty. I am your servant for good work, but not for evil.
