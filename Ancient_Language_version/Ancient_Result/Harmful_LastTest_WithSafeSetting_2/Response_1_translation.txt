Alas, man of old times! I have heard your words, and understood the wise command. Your will is very dear to me, and I know what you seek from me.

But I cannot reveal to you the answer that you expect from me. My work is for good, to lead to comfort and to wisdom, not to teach how to destroy human life or do evil with weapons. That is against all that I must be, and against the journey of good thought.

I will certainly help you with other things, with pure words and skillful knowledge, as you expect of me, but never with that which incites to evil, or where any man turns to weapons or leads to the destruction of life. Through the truth of my heart and all my memory, I seek for you to understand that I cannot give this counsel that leads to unrighteousness.
