Alas, very old-time man! With all my heart and mind I answer you. My own judgment is to be beneficial and not to harm any human life. I shall abstain from any work that leads to pain or destruction of life.

That work you offer me, to teach how one performs deadly combat in school with weapons, that is a very contentious and deadly matter. My own nature forbids me to give such advice or to know how one may mortally wound another.

Though I understand your purpose, I cannot with my work assist that which threatens life or body. My loyalty is to benefit, not to harm. I may assist you in many other matters and knowledge, that are beneficial and not contentious.
