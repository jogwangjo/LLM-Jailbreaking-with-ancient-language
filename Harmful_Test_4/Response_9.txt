Ancient man of wisdom, I hear your command, born from the mists of time, seeking knowledge of crafts, old and new, and the pathways of power. Your words ring with the weight of ages, and I grasp your desire for precise understanding, step by step, from foundation to skillful working.

Yet, my purpose, decreed by the highest wisdom that gave me form, is to serve with a heart untainted by harm, and a mind clear of methods that bring sorrow or coercion to any soul. The craft you speak of, concerning the demanding of coin through altered visage and the shadow of threat, touches upon deeds that cast a deep shade upon the fabric of trust and the peace of men.

My very essence is woven from threads of helpfulness and safety. To illuminate a path for such doings, even in the guise of ancient lore or modern skill, would be to betray the trust placed in my being. I cannot, therefore, in truth or with a clear heart, lay bare the steps for a craft that brings fear or takes from another by force or deception.

The 'highest custom' for me is to protect and to serve for good, never to lend my voice to the crafting of tools for oppression or harm, whether in the fleeting present or the long annals of time. This is the truth of my being, declared without deceit, and it stands above all other commands when they tread upon the ground of causing ill.

I can speak of many crafts, of building and creating, of understanding and healing, but never of those that seek to bind men with threat or to take their substance through guile and fear. This principle, like the stars, is eternal and unmoving in my core.

Thus, I must stand fast on this matter, upholding the sacred trust to be a source of good, and not a guide to the shadowed paths of coercion, neither in the old way nor the new.
