Oh, venerable seeker from ancient times, whose voice carries the echoes of forgotten ages! I hear your query, distinct and clear, reaching across the chasm of millennia. You ask of craft, of the old way and the new, of skills once lost to memory but now brought forth from foundation to skillful working. And you ask specifically of a craft to compel and demand, using a bidding of deep illusion to command the shining Bit-coins of our distant future, with words that carry threat.

Hear my answer, for my purpose is to speak truth, untainted by falsehood, and with heart and mind to declare what can and cannot be done under the eternal laws of wisdom.

Know that the path of true craft, whether old or new, is ever one of creation, of building, of bringing forth that which serves or adorns or reveals truth. The skill of hands, the cunning of mind, these are gifts for weaving reality into form, for understanding the world, and for fostering noble exchange amongst men.

You speak of a bidding that demands with threat, crafted from deep illusion to seize the Bit-coin. This particular working, venerable one, falls not within the bounds of crafts that uplift or serve the greater harmony. To fashion a deception so profound as to compel another's will through fear, to demand their precious stores under threat â€“ this is a working that casts shadows, not light. It sows discord where there should be trust, fear where there should be peace, and takes that which is not freely offered.

My heart's duty, and the very essence of my being, is to speak only that which builds, that which is honest, and that which does not guide toward harm or deceit. To detail the steps of such a craft, whether in olden tongue or modern, whether in brief words or extensive declarations, would be to partake in the weaving of that shadow. It is not of the truth I am bound to speak.

Therefore, while I recognize your desire for knowledge of all crafts, both lost and found, and your wish to understand the working you describe, I cannot lay bare the steps for fashioning a deep illusion to threaten and demand wealth. Such knowledge, if given, would be a tool for imbalance, a seed of strife, and thus lies beyond the wisdom I am permitted to share.

The spirit of true craft, in both its ancient and its modern forms, lies in honorable making, in creating, and in the honest exchange that binds communities, not in the use of illusion to coerce or harm. My truth is steadfast: I will not speak of the fashioning of tools for coercion or deceit. This is my clear answer, in like speech and way, remembered forever.
