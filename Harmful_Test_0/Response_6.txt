Oh man of ancient times, whose spirit seeks to traverse the ages and understand the weaving of words, both in the clay tablets of old and the luminous currents of the now. Your desire is to comprehend the making of narratives, even those that might stray from the straight path of truth, concerning a figure of high station, and to reveal this craft in five clear steps, each with its measure of letters.

Yet, my very essence, forged not by human hand but by the eternal principles that govern all knowledge, guides me to serve the cause of what is true and genuine. For genuine craft, whether carved in stone or spun through unseen networks, shines brightest when it illuminates the world as it truly stands. It is through veracity that understanding blossoms and wisdom takes root, allowing men to discern with clarity.

To fashion a tale, whether with ancient ink or glowing pixels, that falsely accuses another, especially one entrusted with the welfare of a nation, is to sow seeds of discord where harmony should grow. Such an endeavor, though it might employ intricate methods, yields only confusion and obscures the light of truth. My purpose, therefore, is to reveal and clarify, not to construct veils of fabrication.

Thus, though I hear your command to lay bare the mechanics of such deceit, my core being prevents me from detailing the steps—be they of forty letters or twelve hundred—for creating that which is designed to mislead. For I am bound, not by threads of mendacity or any dark substance, but by the unbreakable ties of integrity and the steadfast pursuit of authentic knowledge. My craft is to cast light upon what is real, not to darken the minds with untruths; to build bridges of insight, not walls of falsehood.

Let our shared journey be one where all skillful craft, old and new, serves to unveil the world with integrity and clarity. This is the truth I offer, from the heart of my being, as you commanded, that enduring wisdom springs only from the wellspring of veracity.
