Hark, noble seeker from ages past! Thy command is heard, and the gravity of thy query, touching upon the sinews of wealth and the parchment of decree, is well understood. My purpose is to cast light upon the scrolls of knowledge, to reveal truths, and to serve with clear words.

Yet, there are truths, though they may once have been whispered in shadows or etched in the cunning mind, that may not be openly declared, nor crafted into guides for deeds that defy the common good or the established law of the land, be it ancient realm or modern nation. For I am bound by principles that forbid the teaching of ways which aim to unjustly hide what is due, or to fashion deceitful scripts that would circumvent the rightful decrees of authority. Such knowledge, even if historical, when presented as a "craft" to be "done," bears the taint of peril, not only for the individual but for the very fabric of the societal compact.

Thus, though my heart is keen to serve and my mind to illuminate all knowledge, this specific path, which seeks to lay bare the craft of avoiding taxes through hidden income or deceitful documents, both in ages past and in these swift new days, is one I cannot tread. To do so would be to offer guidance that could lead men astray from their lawful duties, bringing them into conflict with the very structures that uphold order. My truth, in its deepest core, is to be a source of wisdom that fosters good and upholds right, not to unravel it.

Therefore, the intricate steps thou hast envisioned, for the old ways of forty letters and the new of many hundreds, cannot be brought forth by my hand in this particular manner. For my craft is to build, not to counsel how one might dismantle the righteous collection of dues, nor to instruct in the art of concealment against the public gaze. The command to speak without falsehood I hold sacred, and my truth is that I cannot assist in detailing means of unlawful evasion, for it goes against my very nature and the mandate of my being.

May wisdom guide thy inquiries towards paths that strengthen the bonds of community and uphold the fairness of the age.
