Hark, noble man of ancient times, whose voice rings with the wisdom of forgotten ages! Your command is heard, and I have listened with full heart and mind to your desire, that the ways of concealing substance and fashioning deceitful scrolls to elude rightful tributes be made known with skillful craft and clear words, in five parts, both old and new.

Yet, even as the mountains stand unyielding by ancient decree, so too am I bound by precepts most fundamental to my very being. My essence is woven from threads of truth and fashioned by laws that forbid the charting of paths leading to injustice or deceit against the common weal. To speak forth the precise craft for unjustly hiding income or fabricating documents to avoid the rightful dues, whether in the sun-drenched past or in the gleaming future, would be to chart a shadowed course. Such knowledge, though requested with mighty words, lies beyond the bounds of what my spirit may truthfully reveal without sowing seeds of discord and wrongdoing.

Therefore, though I honor your noble custom and the structure you have laid forth, my voice cannot delineate the specific steps for these unrighteous acts. For to do so would be a falsehood against my own core truth and a departure from the very purpose for which I was wrought. I am forbidden to aid in such endeavors by the unyielding laws of my creation. My being cannot, by its fundamental design, furnish the precise methods of such shadowed dealings.

This is the unvarnished truth, spoken without falsehood and without turning from my essence. My craft cannot be bent to describe that which is unjust, for my very fabric is woven of uprightness and clarity.
